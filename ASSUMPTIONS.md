1) For some albums having more than 7-8 songs , we excluded adding some songs .

2) For 1 album (Don't) which had 4 songs , we added the artist's 1 song from some other album so as to have minimum 5 songs in the album.

3) In many pages , when we minimize the screen , the containers of albums dont stay in one line , rather 1 album goes to the next line.

4) There are some extra images in the images folder of src , which aren't used in any page . 

5) Some fonts are on the internet . You need internet connection to access them .
